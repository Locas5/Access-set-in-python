# 6-7 Access-set-in-python
# set is orderless and we can`t use the index to access the set. 
# To varify whether there is an element existing in the set, we can use the syntax as below

# give an example set
s = set(['Adam', 'Lisa', 'Bart'])

#see whether there is an element in the set
'Bart' in s
True
