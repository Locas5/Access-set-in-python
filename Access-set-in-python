accessing set is actually to see if an element existing in set
below we are going to use the syntax to do this
"""

#give an example set
s = set(['Lisa', 'Bart'])

'Lisa' in s
#Out[3]: True

'Bill' in s
#Out[4]: False

# use the lower case to see whether set is sensitive 
'lisa' in s 
#Out[5]: False
#From above, we can see that set is sensitive to cases


"""
Misson: improve the set, make it support lower case. 
"""

#to make set support lower case, we can add the lower cases of the elements
s = set(['Lisa', 'Bart', 'lisa', 'bart'])

#now let`s test
'lisa' in s
'bart' in s
